# my-1st-React-component
My 1st React components from the Tech with Nader YouTube channel.

Nader is a gifted teacher and I love how he takes things slowly, explaining in detail the how & why of JS behavior.  In his exercise videos, he shows you step-by-step how to get things like React or Node (among others) up and running.  I find this aspect of his teaching style particularly helpful.

I am so appreicative of Nader's efforts in educating others that I went to his Patreon account to find out more.  It's so nice to have a channel to go for extra help while doing my bootcamp course.  His teaching style a cheerful demaeanor always make me feel better when I'm struggling to grasp something.

These React components were built in the Stateless Exercise video.  I particularly love the way the Staffy component turned out. Such a cutie!
